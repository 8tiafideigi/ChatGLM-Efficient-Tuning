*Derecho Administrativo* is a comprehensive and updated textbook that covers the main aspects of administrative law in Mexico, from a historical, theoretical, and practical perspective. It analyzes the evolution of administrative law in Mexico since the colonial period until the present day, taking into account the constitutional reforms, the international treaties, and the social and economic changes that have shaped it. It also examines the structure and functions of the public administration, the legal regime of public officials and public services, the administrative acts and contracts, the administrative procedures and sanctions, the administrative litigation and remedies, and the principles and guarantees of administrative law.
 
*Derecho Administrativo* is intended for students, teachers, researchers, lawyers, judges, public officials, and anyone interested in learning more about administrative law in Mexico. It is written in a clear and accessible language, with numerous examples, cases, references, and tables. It also includes a glossary of terms and an index of topics. The book is available in PDF format for download from various online platforms.
  
Administrative law in Mexico is a complex and dynamic field that regulates the relations between the public administration and the individuals or entities that are subject to its authority or that benefit from its services. Administrative law also establishes the mechanisms of control and accountability of the public administration, both internally and externally.
 
Administrative law in Mexico has several sources, such as the Constitution, international treaties, federal and local laws, administrative regulations, administrative acts and contracts, jurisprudence, and customary law. The Constitution is the supreme source of administrative law, as it defines the principles, limits, and guarantees of the public administration. International treaties are also binding for the public administration, as long as they do not contradict the Constitution. Federal and local laws are enacted by the legislative branch at each level of government, within their respective competences. Administrative regulations are issued by the executive branch or by autonomous constitutional bodies to complement or develop the laws. Administrative acts and contracts are issued or entered into by the public administration in the exercise of its functions. Jurisprudence is formed by the decisions of the judicial branch or by specialised tribunals that resolve disputes involving administrative matters. Customary law is recognised as a source of administrative law when it does not contravene any other source.
 
Administrative law in Mexico is applied and enforced by various authorities and institutions, depending on the nature and scope of each case. The main authorities and institutions involved in administrative law are:
 
- The executive branch at the federal and local levels, which is responsible for directing and managing the public administration according to the Constitution and the laws.
- The legislative branch at the federal and local levels, which is responsible for enacting and amending the laws that regulate the public administration.
- The judicial branch at the federal and local levels, which is responsible for resolving disputes between individuals or entities and the public administration, as well as disputes between different levels or branches of government.
- The autonomous constitutional bodies, such as the National Human Rights Commission, the Federal Economic Competition Commission, or the National Institute for Transparency, Access to Information and Personal Data Protection, which have specific functions and powers related to administrative law.
- The specialised tribunals, such as the Federal Court of Administrative Justice or the Federal Electoral Tribunal, which have jurisdiction over certain matters of administrative law.
- The internal control organs, such as the Ministry of Public Administration or the Superior Audit Office of the Federation, which are in charge of overseeing and auditing the performance of the public administration.
- The social participation mechanisms, such as consultations, petitions, complaints, or referendums, which allow citizens to express their opinions or demands regarding administrative matters.

Administrative law in Mexico is constantly evolving and adapting to the changing needs and challenges of society. Some of the current trends and issues in administrative law are:
