Note that this method depends on the performance of your PC and your internet connection. If they are not fast enough, you may experience lag, stuttering, or low quality graphics.
  
## Method 2: Using GeForce Now
  
GeForce Now is a cloud gaming service that lets you play PC games on various devices, including Chromebooks. You will need a GeForce Now account and a good internet connection for this method. Here are the steps to follow:
