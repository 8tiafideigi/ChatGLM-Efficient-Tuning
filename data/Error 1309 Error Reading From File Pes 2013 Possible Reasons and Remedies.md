PES 2013 is a popular soccer game that requires a lot of files to run properly. Sometimes, when you try to install the game, you may encounter an error message like this:
 
**Download File ⚹ [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Furlin.us%2F2uwVWT&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw17TAwgPQiuKIML\_sAc0-yq](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Furlin.us%2F2uwVWT&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw17TAwgPQiuKIML_sAc0-yq)**


 

> Error 1309. Error reading from file: C:\Users\...Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.

This error means that the installer cannot find or access one of the files that it needs to install the game. There are several possible causes and solutions for this error, which we will discuss in this article.
 
## Possible Causes of Error 1309
 
According to various sources[^1^] [^2^], some of the common causes of error 1309 are:
 
- Insufficient permissions to the destination folder in which the game is being installed.
- The path to either the source folder or the destination folder has more than 256 characters.
- Compromised or corrupted game installation package.

## Possible Solutions for Error 1309
 
Depending on the cause of the error, you may try one or more of the following solutions:

1. Check and correct user permissions. Locate the folder in which PES 2013 is being installed (the default path is C:\Program Files\Konami\). Right-click the folder and select Properties. If your name or the name of your user group is not listed under Group or user names, click Edit and add your name or group. If Full Control is not selected under Permissions for SYSTEM, click Edit and select Full Control. Click Apply or OK to save your edits. Try to install again.
2. Check and shorten the file path length. Check the number of characters in the full Windows path to the source folder containing the files from which youâre installing. Also check the number of characters in the path leading to the destination folder in which youâre installing the game. If either path is longer than 256 characters, shorten it. One way to shorten the path to the source folder is to run the game installer from a folder on your C drive rather than from your desktop. For example, run the game installer from C:\PES2013.
3. Download and install a fresh copy of PES 2013. Sometimes, the game installation package may be damaged or corrupted during download or transfer. To ensure that you have a complete and valid installation package, download PES 2013 again from a trusted source. You can also use a download manager to resume interrupted downloads and verify file integrity. After downloading, run a virus scan on the installation package before installing it.

## Conclusion
 
Error 1309 is a common error that may occur when installing PES 2013 or other games that require a lot of files. The error indicates that the installer cannot find or access one of the files that it needs to install the game. The error may be caused by insufficient permissions, long file paths, or compromised installation packages. To fix the error, you can try checking and correcting user permissions, checking and shortening file paths, or downloading and installing a fresh copy of PES 2013.
